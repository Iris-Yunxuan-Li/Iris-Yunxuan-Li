# About me

I am a math PhD student at the University of Chicago working on algebraic topology. 

Outside of my research, I have a strong passion for studying machine learning and applying it to solve real-world problems. I enjoy experimenting with various projects that involve data analysis, algorithm development, and predictive modeling.

## Interests
**Mathematics**: Algebraic topology, homotopy theory, and category theory.

**Machine Learning**: Neural networks and time series analysis.

**Programming**: Proficient in Python. Familiar with MATLAB and Sage.

<!-- **Projects**: Developing machine learning models, data visualization, and creating interactive web applications. -->

## Experience
**Research Assistant**: Studying properties of topological Hochschild homology and topylogical cyclic homology.

**Instructor**: Taught the calculus 130's and 150's sequence at the university of Chicago.

**Teaching Assistant**: Assisted in teaching undergraduate courses in differential equations, linear algebra, and Markov chains.


## Hobbies

Learning new machine leaning models, leaning new math, knitting 🧶, traveling, and playing with my two cats 🐈🐈.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss mathematics, machine learning, or any interesting projects you have in mind!
